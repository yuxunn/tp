## **Design**

### Architecture

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="314" />
</div>


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.


<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />
</div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.png" width="370" />
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="629"/>
</div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="900"/>
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ParserClasses.png" width="745"/>
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="679" />
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search/sort query) as a separate _filtered and sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The following diagram shows the classes that extend the abstract `Person` class.
<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="179" />
</div>

The abstract `Person` class is extended by two separate classes, `Lead` and `Client`. These instances are distinguished by their `Type` field in `Person`.
`Lead` objects also contain an additional `KeyMilestone` attribute.
### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="683" />
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View Specific Person feature
Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `SampleAddressBook` will be initialised.

Step 2: The user executes `addclient n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` to add a new Client.

Step 3: The user executes a `view 1` command to view the 1st person in the address book. The user’s command is parsed by `ViewCommandParser` which extracts the target index. The `ViewCommand` class is instantiated with the extracted index. `ViewCommand` class interacts with `Model#FilteredPersonList` to verify the validity of the index and retrieve the corresponding person’s details. The command execution would be encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object that is then returned back from `Logic`.

**Note:** If the index given is more than the size of the list or when the index given is 0, `ViewCommand` will not call `Model#view(Person personToView)`. Instead, a `MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX` exception will be thrown. The Main Window display continue displaying the `PersonListPanel` UI instead of the  `ViewWindow` UI

The following sequence diagram shows how the View Command works:
<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram.png" alt= "ViewSequenceDiagram" width="900"/>
</div>

### Add client/Add lead feature

#### Implementation

The `Client` and `Lead` model extends from `Person`.
The `Client` and `Lead` model has a name, address, phone number, email field which is compulsory, as well as a meeting time and tags field which are optional.
The `Lead` model has an additional compulsory field called Key Milestone.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `addclient` and `addlead` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/beforeaddclient.png" alt="before command" width="500" />
    <p>Before any commands</p>
</div>

Step 2a - `addclient`. The user executes `addclient n/John Doe...` command add a person named John Doe into the AddressBook. The `addclient` command calls `Model#addClient()`, causing the address book to be updated.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/afterusingaddclient.png" alt="after addclient command" width="500" />
    <p>After addclient command</p>
</div>

Step 2b - `addlead`. The user executes `addlead n/John Doe...` command add a person named John Doe into the AddressBook. The `addlead` command calls `Model#addLead()`, causing the address book to be updated.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/afterusingaddlead.png" alt="after addlead command" width="500" />
    <p>After addlead command</p>
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addclient` operation works (Note that `addlead` works in the same way but calls `Model#addLead()` instead):
<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/AddClientSequenceDiagram.png" width="900"/>
</div>

The following activity diagram shows the workflow upon execution of the `addclient` command (`addlead` works the same way):
<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/AddClientActivityDiagram.png" width="500"/>
</div>

### Add Meeting Time feature

#### Implementation

The user can specify a meeting time when executing `addclient` or `addlead` command with the `m/` flag or enter the `addmeeting` command to add a meeting time to an existing client or lead.
The `addmeeting` command takes in the index of the client or lead, and the meeting time in `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm` format (e.g. `addmeeting 1 12/12/2023 12:00`).
The `AddMeetingCommand` class facilitates this by copying the person (client/lead) based on the index given, and creates a new person with the meeting time added.
The `AddMeetingCommand` class then calls `Model#setPerson()` to update the address book with the new person.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addmeeting ...` operation works:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/AddMeetingTimeSequenceDiagram.png" width="900"/>
</div>

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the execution of the `addmeeting ...` command:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/AddMeetingTimeActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />
</div>

### List clients and leads feature

#### Implementation

The user can view a filtered list of clients or leads when executing `listclient` or `listlead` command respectively. These commands are implemented as follows:

The `execute()` command in `ListClientCommand` or `ListLeadCommand` is executed.

The `execute()` command in `ListClientCommand` or `ListLeadCommand` iterates over the `persons` list in the `ModelManager` object.

For each person in the persons list, the `isClient()` function is used to check if the person is a `Client` for `ListClientCommand` and `isLead()` function is used to check if the person is a `Lead` for `ListLeadCommand`.

If the person is a `Client` or `Lead` object, depending on the command `ListClientCommand` or `ListLeadCommand`, would filter the list, and the GUI would display the filtered list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `listclient` and `listlead` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user opens the application to see a list of leads and clients.

Step 2. The user executes `listclient` command to display a filtered list of persons in the address book. The `listclient` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`, causing the modified state of the filtered list to be displayed based on the `predicate` passed into the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listclient` operation works (Note that `listlead` works in the same way:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ListClientCommandSequence.png" width="800" />
    <p>After addlead command</p>
</div>

###  Convert lead to client and client to lead feature

#### Implementation

The user can convert client to leads  and vice versa, using  the command `converttolead` and `converttoclient` respectively.

The `execute()` command in `ConvertLeadToClientCommand` or `ConvertClientToLeadCommand` is executed.

The `execute()` command in `ConvertLeadToClientCommand` or `ConvertClientToLeadCommand` takes in an argument of type `Index`, and is referred to the list of items

If the person is a `Lead` when using `converttoclient`, the application would create a new `Client` object with the information from `Lead` class. Similarly, this also would occur for `converttolead`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `converttoclient` and `converttolead` behaves at each step

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ConvertLeadToClientSequence.png" width = "900"/>
    <p>After converttoclient command</p>
</div>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes `converttoclient`:
<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/ConvertClientToLeadActivity.png" height="300"/>
    <p>After converttoclient command</p>
</div>

### Sort Meeting Time feature

#### Implementation

The user can view the upcoming meetings scheduled with leads and clients sorted in chronological order. The command is implemented as follows.

The `execute()` command in `SortMeetingTimeCommand` calls the `sortFilteredPersonList()` in `Model`, which first filters and returns a `FilteredList` containing only persons with a meeting time.
This list is then sorted using the `PersonMeetingTimeComparator` to obtain the desired `SortedList` output, which is then displayed.

Note that in every other operation that updates the `ObservableList` to be displayed, the `null` comparator is used instead of the `PersonMeetingTimeComparator` so no sorting occurs.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sortmeeting` operation works:

<div align="center">
    <img src="diagrams/SortMeetingTimeSequenceDiagram.png" width = "900"/>
</div>

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. **Client Policy Management:** The current functionality falls short in allowing student financial advisors to monitor clients' policies and follow up as needed, as it lacks the ability to add, edit, and delete client policies.  To address this limitation, we intend to develop these features in the future, ensuring student financial advisors can efficiently manage policy-related tasks.
