### Project: D.A.V.E.

D.A.V.E. is a leads and clients management tool for student financial advisors.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to view specific lead / client command.
    - **What it does:** Allows the user to view a specified lead or client.
    - **Justification:** This feature improves the product significantly because a user would be able to view a lead's or 
client's additional details that are not displayed in the main list. 
    - **Difficulty:** To implement this feature, I had to design a new UI for the profile page and learn how the current UI logic of the address book worked. 
 I also had to learn how to retrieve relevant data for the view display and implement the logic for the  ``view`` command.
